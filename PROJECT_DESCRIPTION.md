# MyLaunch

## Project Description (Elevator Pitch)

For those interested in things that happened the day they were born this is perfect! Everyone loves space and so by entering your birthday (or any other date) you can find out if a rocket was launched the day you were born thanks to the [Launch Library API](https://www.launchlibrary.net/docs/1.3/api.html#tippitytop)

## Motivation for creating this project

I have always loved space and so this will be a fun thing for me to use and show my family and friends. Hopefully it will also be a good site for my portfolio.

## How will users interact with the web site?

The user will enter a landing page with a short description of what the app is and be presented with a button to go to the app page. On the app page the user will be presented with a date input centered on their screen asking for their birthday - upon selection a loading indicator will be presented. Once loaded, the rocket information will be provided if there was one that day.
