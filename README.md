# MyLaunch

## Project Description (Elevator Pitch)

For those interested in things that happened the day they were born this is perfect! Everyone loves space and so by entering your birthday (or any other date) you can find out if a rocket was launched the day you were born thanks to the [Launch Library API](https://www.launchlibrary.net/docs/1.3/api.html#tippitytop)

## Where can I find it?

## Motivation for creating this project

I have always loved space and so this will be a fun thing for me to use and show my family and friends. Hopefully it will also be a good site for my portfolio.
